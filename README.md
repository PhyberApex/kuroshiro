# KUROSHIRO: Unleash Your TRMNL!

**Kuroshiro** is an open-source BYOS (Bring Your Own Server) solution for the [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) ecosystem. Our goal is to give you more flexibility and control over your TRMNL experience, whether you're self-hosting for fun, learning, or customization. Kuroshiro bundles a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) API and a [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) UI into a single Docker image, ready to run alongside your own Postgres database.

|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| next   | Always build from the latest code changes in `main`                      |
| latest | The newest released version                                              |
| x.x.x  | Specific version that has been built and can be found in GitHub releases |

For local hacking or deployment inspiration, check out [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml). It spins up everything you need‚ÄîAPI, UI, and Postgres‚Äîso you can get started in seconds.

## üñ•Ô∏è How Screens Work

### Mirroring from Official Server
If you enable mirroring and provide the MAC and apikey, Kuroshiro fetches the current screen from the official server‚Äîmirroring always takes priority.

### Screens Managed by Kuroshiro
Screens can be added after your device fetches a screen at least once (so we know its size!).

#### Uploaded Screens
Upload a file and Kuroshiro uses Imagemagick to fit, fill, and convert it to black and white. Stored locally, ready to go.

#### External Link Screens
Provide a URL and Kuroshiro fetches, converts, and serves it. Cache it for speed, or fetch fresh every time‚Äîyour choice!

#### HTML Screens
Provide HTML you can make use of the [TRMNL framework](https://usetrmnl.com/framework).
